**NOTE:** For gradle ver i still don't know the compatibilty across flutter, dart, java, but personally i use 8.3


#### How to run the apps on real devices(Android)

There is some way to run it on your phone
1. Using your hotspot phone
2. Connect it with USB cable(USB debug)
3. Connect it wireless using the same wifi router

I recommend to use wireless method **(method 3)** since that is the most convenient way

**NOTE:** All of this way is need to use ADB (Android Debug Bridge), adb comes in with the android SDK **(assuming you're already download Android SDK 35)**


#### How to connect it wireless

1. **Go to Developer Options**

    - Open your phone's Settings

    - Scroll to "About phone"

    - Tap "Build number" 7 times until it says ‚ÄúYou are now a developer‚Äù

    - Go back to Settings > System > Developer Options (or just search for ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù)

2. **Enable USB Debugging**

    - In Developer Options, find and enable USB debugging
    
    - connect your phone to your pc via USB cable

    - run 'adb devices' to verify your devices is detected

    - run 'adb tcpip 5555' to make ip static

    - wait for a while and disconnect your phone

3. **Enable Wireless Debugging**

    - In Developer Options, find and enable Wireless debugging

4. **Tap on "Wireless debugging"**

    - This opens the wireless debugging options

    - You can see your phone IP & Port there, but since we already make static Port which is easier to connect, we can ignore the phone Port

    - On your run 'adb connect (ip):(port)'
