spong flutter for mobile


Follow the official documentation of Flutter to set up: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile

NOTE*: u don't need to setup android studio if u not running the apps in there, u only need the android SDK 35 and good to go.


----Common Commands----

flutter clean          # Clean build files
flutter pub get        # Fetch dependencies
flutter doctor         # Diagnose setup issues
flutter devices        # List connected devices
flutter build apk      # Build release APK
flutter run            # run the project 
flutter --version      # version check
